                <h3>What is CyberSecurity?</h3>
                <p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security.
                The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Network security</b> is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.</li>
                    <li><b>Application security</b> focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.</li>
                    <li><b>Information security</b> protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.</li>
                    <li><b>Operational security</b> includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.</li>
                    <li><b>Disaster recovery and business continuity</b> define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.</li>
                    <li><b>End-user education addresses</b> the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2><u>Cyber Attack</u></h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks of computer data, or trick users to gain illegal access.</li>
                <li>Some cyberattacks are new forms of crime which can only be committed using ICTs, such as hacking and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.</li><li> In the last few years, cyberattacks have become more sophisticated and pose an increasing risk to national security.
                    </li><li>
                    There are many motives behind attacks, from sabotage and espionage to theft, fraud, ‘hacktivism’ and others.
                    </li><li>
                    
                    Attacks can either be targeted – for example, the Stuxnet malware attack on Iran’s nuclear systems – or untargeted, like phishing emails which trawl vast numbers of email addresses.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2><u>Prevention Techniques-5 Ways</u></h2>
             <ol><li><b>Train your staff:-</b>
                One of the most common ways cyber criminals get access to your data is through your employees. They’ll send fraudulent emails impersonating someone in your organisation and will either ask for personal details or for access to certain files. Links often seem legitimate to an untrained eye and it’s easy to fall into the trap. This is why employee awareness is vital.
                
                One of the most efficient ways to protect against cyber attacks and all types of data breaches is to train your employees on cyber attack prevention and inform them of current cyber attacks.
                
                   
                </li><li>
                
                <b>Keep your software and systems fully up to date:-</b>
                
                Often cyber attacks happen because your systems or software aren’t fully up to date, leaving weaknesses. So cybercriminals exploit these weaknesses to gain access to your network. Once they are in – it’s often too late to take preventative action.
                
                To counteract this, it’s smart to invest in a patch management system that will manage all software and system updates, keeping your system resilient and up to date.</li><li>
                <b>Ensure Endpoint Protection:-</b>
                
                    Endpoint protection protects networks that are remotely bridged to devices. Mobile devices, tablets and laptops that are connected to corporate networks give access paths to security threats. These paths need protected with specific endpoint protection software.</li>
                <li><b> Install a Firewall:-</b>
                    There are so many different types of sophisticated data breaches and new ones surface every day and even make comebacks.
                    
                    Putting your network behind a firewall is one of the most effective ways to defend yourself from any cyber attack. A firewall system will block any brute force attacks made on your network and/or systems before it can do any damage, something we can help you with.
                </li>
                <li><b> Backup your data:-</b>
                    In the event of a disaster (often a cyber attack) you must have your data backed up to avoid serious downtime, loss of data and serious financial loss.</li></ul>
